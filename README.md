A three-column site with the universal top navigation. Clean & minimal :smile:.  
Usage: Hosting of personal site, blog, portfolio on Netlify, GitHub or self-hosting on own server.

## Facets

Main reasons why this is great:

1. __Security aware__. Get A+ scores on [Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/doks.netlify.app) out of the box. Easily change the default Security Headers to suit your needs.

2. __Fast by default__. Get 100 scores on [Google Lighthouse](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/?gist=59aafe464a68f8bc30b8e9a636d5b053) by default. Doks removes unused css, prefetches links, and lazy loads images.

3. __SEO-ready__. Use sensible defaults for structured data, open graph, and Twitter cards. Or easily change the SEO settings to your liking.

4. __Development tools__. Code with confidence. Check styles, scripts, and markdown for errors and fix automatically or manually.

5. __Bootstrap framework__. Build robust, flexible, and intuitive websites with Bootstrap 5. Easily customize your Doks site with the source Sass files.

6. __Netlify-ready__. Deploy to Netlify with sensible defaults. Easily use Netlify Functions, Netlify Redirects, and Netlify Headers.

7. __Full text search__. Search your Doks site with FlexSearch. Easily customize index settings and search options to your liking.

8. __Page layouts__. Build pages with a landing page, blog, or documentation layout. Add custom sections and components to suit your needs.

9. __Dark mode__. Switch to a low-light UI with the click of a button. Change colors with variables to match your branding.
