title : "Hi, I'm Prateek Bhagdev ðŸ™Œ"
description: "I come from Shahdol, a small town in India. I completed my bachelors degree in Computer Science & Engineering, & Yeah... I dropped out of Electronics & Communication Engineering prior to that. I graduated as PGD in Advance Computing from Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, & PGD in Information Technology Management from Symbiosis Centre for Management & Human Resource Development.

I work in the fields of Product Management, Design, Technology, HCI & Human Factors. I believe there is lot that we can apply & connect with these fields into this huge universe, & vice versa. I do what I love and I love what I do. I like thinking, observing, & working on ideas whenever have one. I believe in creating opportunities and possibilities in the world by amalgamation of technology and creativity.

I love to help create compelling products with emphasis on design & technology. I possess keen interest for AI, gesture interfaces, touchable technology & mobility. My key skills include product strategy & roadmap definition, persona identification, user journey mapping, product prototyping & testing, user research & analysis, nurture & commercialize products & solutions for different platforms such as zero interfaces, smart interfaces, wearables, mobile devices & desktops etc.

I follow motor sports & profoundly the Formula 1 ðŸš€

Bragging rights: Iâ€™ve been almost shot at while writing a code logic in a 120-degree tent, Iâ€™ve made ice-creams out of Water Only, and Iâ€™m a pretty good cook :smile:"
